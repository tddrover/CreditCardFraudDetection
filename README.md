# Credit Card Fraud Detection and Presentation

A R script that demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a fraud detection model using the Random Forest algorithm in R, including data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation. As well as an R Markdown document that presents the credit card detection script.

Disclaimer: Used Online help and guides to help with the fraud detection algorithm. Markdown file that explains the code is fully original. You can find some of my sources here: https://onecompiler.com/r/3zk62dwmn   |     https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data

Includes:
- An R markdown script that will present the detection script and explain it
- The Fraud Detection algorithm written in R
- Does NOT include the Excel File used that contains the credit card information
