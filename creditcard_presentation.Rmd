```

## Our Code

```
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(dplyr)
library(ROSE)
library(randomForest)
library(rpart.plot)
library(xgboost)
library(ggplot2)

file_name<- paste(getwd(),"/fraudTrain.csv",sep='') 
credit_card<-read.csv(file_name)

credit_card$is_fraud = as.factor(credit_card$is_fraud)
credit_card.true = credit_card[credit_card$is_fraud == 0,]
credit_card.false = credit_card[credit_card$is_fraud == 1,]
```

## Pie Chart Code

```
labels = c("NON_FRAUD","FRAUD")
labels = paste(labels,round(prop.table(table(credit_card$is_fraud))*100,2))
labels = paste0(labels,"%")
pie(table(credit_card$is_fraud),labels,col = c("blue","red"),
    main = "Pie Chart of Credit Card Transactions")
```

## Output

```{r Pie Chart, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
file_name<- paste(getwd(),"/fraudTrain.csv",sep='') 
credit_card<-read.csv(file_name)

credit_card$is_fraud = as.factor(credit_card$is_fraud)
credit_card.true = credit_card[credit_card$is_fraud == 0,]
credit_card.false = credit_card[credit_card$is_fraud == 1,]

labels = c("NON_FRAUD","FRAUD")
labels = paste(labels,round(prop.table(table(credit_card$is_fraud))*100,2))
labels = paste0(labels,"%")
pie(table(credit_card$is_fraud),labels,col = c("blue","red"),
    main = "Pie Chart of Credit Card Transactions")
```



## Data Splitting Code
This splits the data for 80% to train the model, and 20% to test it

```
rows = nrow(credit_card)
cols = ncol(credit_card)

set.seed(123)
credit_card = credit_card[sample(rows),1:cols]
ntr = as.integer(round(0.8*rows))

credit_card.train = credit_card[1:ntr,1:cols] # for train
credit_card.test = credit_card[(ntr+1):rows,-cols] # for test input
credit_card.testc = credit_card[(ntr+1):rows,cols] # for test data CLass

credit_card.testc = as.data.frame(credit_card.testc)
colnames(credit_card.testc)[1] = c("is_fraud")
```
## Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest is a learning algorithm that takes grows and combines decision trees to make a forest

It predicts by taking averages from multiple trees

The more trees the more precise it becomes

```
samp = as.integer(0.49*ntr)
rF = randomForest(is_fraud ~ . ,data =credit_card.train,ntree = 39,
                  samplesize = samp,maxnodes=44)
rF_pred = predict(rF,credit_card.test)
credit_card.testc$Pred = rF_pred

print(confusionMatrix(credit_card.testc$Pred,credit_card.testc$is_fraud))
```

## Output

## What It Means
It predicted it was not fraud correctly 257,859 times     

Predicted it was fraud when it wasn't fraud 19 times     

Predicted it wasn't fraud when it was 1390 times        

And it predicted it was fraud correctly 67 times       

Its accuracy was 99.46%
